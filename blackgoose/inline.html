<h2><dfn>Low and Slow</dfn></h2>

<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new
cooking technique called sous vide.<br> In sous vide
cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed
in plastic) into a <br> water bath that is precisely
set to the target temperature you want the food
to be cooked to.<br> In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>,
Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature
poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <em>Sous Vide Salmon
with Dill Hollandaise</em>.<br> To reserve a seat at the chef
table, contact us <u><b>before November 30.</b></u></p>

pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have
immunity issues.</i></small></p>
